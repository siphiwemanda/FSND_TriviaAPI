# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

This project was built as part of the Udacity Full Stack nano degree. The goals of this project are detailed bellow 

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others. 

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

Once you have you environment up and running, install your dependence's by running 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

This project uses NPM to run, start the server by running 
```bash
npm start
```
[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
